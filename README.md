AutoTyper - A Data Entry Tool

Sometimes we have to write a content in programs where copy-paste is not allowed even website disable right click button or Keywords such as " ctrl C " and " ctrl V ", like in Data Entry Software or some other restricted website. There are many tools or Software available online but almost all of them are paid  or they provide trial versions. And they requires big payment for continued access. And even if they are free, it is not wise to give complete access to a keyboard to any third-party software. then it will be totally dangerous and harmfull for your system i.e. why i had wrote this simple-short python script which reads content which you provide them then it simulates keyboard tyoing. This Script works with both Linux And Windows System
